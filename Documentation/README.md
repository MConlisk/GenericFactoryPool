# GenericFactoryPool
The GenericFactoryPool is a C# class that provides a generic object pool for creating and recycling objects of various types. Object pooling helps improve performance by reusing objects instead of repeatedly creating and destroying them. The GenericFactoryPool has a maximum size that can be set to limit the number of objects in the pool.
